The optional-silence phone sil occupies 21.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 67.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 17.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 10.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (31,37.6,78)
